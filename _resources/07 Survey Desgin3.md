Topic: Review of empirically validated methods and strategies for optimizing the visual design elements of surveys.

This document follows the recommendations of the Tailored Design Method by D.A. Dillman (2014).

# Introduction
-   The visual design of the survey and questions can significantly impact whether and how people will respond. Visual design can minimize measurement error and item nonresponse, but if it is done poorly it can exacerbate both.
-   What might seem like an insignificant decision can strongly impact respondents' answers.

# Overall Survey Design
-   Avoid Visual Clutter.
-   Standardize the design properties of questions, answer spaces, and response options.
-   Visual navigation guides, used in a consistent way, are important to make it easy for respondents to follow the prescribed navigational path.
-   Use darker/larger font for the question stem in comparison to answer choices to create contrast and separate the question stem and answer choices.
-   Use visual elements consistently to emphasize or deemphasize certain types of information. For example, do not include or minimize the salience of elements that are not important for respondents, such as extra information that is important for data processing or scoring.
-   Use color, contrast, and enclosure (e.g. placing a box around the area) to help respondents recognize the different components and the navigational path through the survey.
    -   Lightly shaded backgrounds help responses identify regions where they should focus, and allows the use of white answer spaces to highlight where answers are required.
    -   Consistently identify the beginning of each question or section. For example through the use of numbering questions which will help participants understand the organization and ordering of the survey components.
-   Design the survey with professionalism in mind and consider the population in choosing a font size (usually 10- to 12- point font is recommended for most populations).


# Visual Design of Questions and Answer Choices
-   Use arrows when certain choice options require participants to write additional information or skip an item. Place instructions (written or graphical) exactly where they are needed rather than including them as free-standing entities. Examples of integrating instructions in question stem and use of arrows:

-   Some questions may require optional/occasional instructions (such as example question \#8 above), and this information should be presented in a less salient manner (such as un-bolded, italicized font).
-   Encourage the use of the desired response type by providing appropriately sized response fields, and labels near the answer field, and templates with answer spaces. Provide a single answer box if only one answer is needed and multiple answer boxes if multiple answers are needed. Examples:

-   Minimize the use of matrices and grids, and when used simplify as much as possible.
    -   Visual cues (lines, shading) should be used to make it easy to move across the grid. Every answer choice in the grid can be labeled to ease the task of responding. Large grids can be broken down into a series of smaller grids.
-   In terms question length per line, a moderate line length of 3 to 5 inches is recommended.
    -   Long lines may make it difficult to track along the lines, and short lines require a lot of eye movement to move to the next line.
-   Ensure there is equal spacing between answer choices and between questions.
    -   Items located close together will be perceived as belonging together. Ensure there is equal spacing between answer choices even if some answer choices are longer. In the examples below, the first answer choice is chosen more often in the example on the left (where there is uneven spacing) relative to the example on the right.

-   Ensure that the conceptual and visual mid-point of the answer choices are both aligned. Non-substantive answer choices (such as 'don't know', 'undecided') should be placed after and spaced a little further from the substantive answer choices. For example:

-   Consider using uniquely shaped answer spaces (circles and squares) to help respondents distinguish between different types of questions (single- and multiple-answer choice questions, respectively).
