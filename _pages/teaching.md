A cornerstone of my teaching philosophy is the alignment of learning outcomes, assessments, and active learning strategies. I take a 'course-long perspective' whereby assignments and activities are designed in relation to each other, each developing skills that are further reinforced by the next task. I also aim to provide opportunities to apply the course material through hands-on components. I strive to provide an engaging and supportive classroom environment through the utilization of various active learning techniques, such polls and games using iClickers/online platforms to review material, debates, and think-pair-share activities. The goal of such activities and classroom discussions is to engender a sense of community, learn from the perspectives of others, and allow for opportunities to apply, analyze, and evaluate during classroom discussions.
