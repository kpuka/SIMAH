Topic: Review of empirically validated methods and strategies for designing effective surveys and questions.

This document follows the recommendations of the Tailored Design Method by D.A. Dillman (2014).

# Overview of Writting Effective Questions
Always consider how the questions, questionnaire, and invitation contacts will look from a respondent's perspective; consider if each design feature will help people in some way, if it will not, then it should not be used. The most critical questions for the analyses may be asked first to ensure they are completed, and more sensitive information (e.g. income) can be asked at the end when trust and rapport have developed. Notably however, ff the main objective is to replicate a previous survey or make the new results comparable in some other way, usually no changes or only minimal changes can be made to the survey.

Many important decisions have to be made when writing effective questions. These decisions differ depending on the intent and format of the question that is being written. In addition, what might seem like an insignificant decision can strongly impact respondents' answers.


# Identify Your Primary Aims
First, you must have clear research questions to identify what needs to be measured and that all essential topics will be evaluated. Break down the concepts of interest until you get to subdomains that can be measured with a single question. If standardized measures are available, they should only be adopted if they are well written and suited to your particular needs for the project. 

It is important to think about and plan the key analyses before finalizing the survey design. Consider what variables will be needed and their possible answer choices. It may be best to think about the results you want to display (creating tables with labels and variable names), then work backwards from the desired tables/figures to determine what question format is needed for each item.


# Designing Effective Questions

Example 1: 
<br><img src='/images/posts/survey_design/Slide1.JPG'><br>

Key take aways: 
-  Ask questions that apply to all respondents (e.g. it must require an answer from all respondents)
-  Ask questions one at a time
-  Ensure there is a clear separation of questions and answers
-  Consider using uniquely shaped answer spaces to distinguish between different types of questions

-  Use arrows and visual cues to provide a clear navigational path
-  Use forced choice-responses to help ensure that respondents carefully consider each option and make a decision, as opposed to 'check-all-that-apply' answer choices 

Example 2: 
<br><img src='/images/posts/survey_design/Slide2.JPG'><br>

Key take aways:  
-   Reduce complexity - question stem and response options should match
-   Provide balanced scales – categories should be relatively equal distance apart
-   Avoid having too many response options – may become difficult to differentiate
-   Use positive and negative side in question stem; for unipolar scales use “if at all”
-   Do not include or minimize salience of elements not important for respondents

Example 3: 
<br><img src='/images/posts/survey_design/Slide3.JPG'><br>

Key points: 
-  Use complete sentences
-  Use specific, concrete language – do not allow room for interpretation
-  Use simple, familiar language – avoid abbreviations or specialized language 
-  Encourage use of desired response types by providing appropriately sizes response fields and labels close to response field

Example 4: 
<br><img src='/images/posts/survey_design/Slide4.JPG'><br>

Key points: 
-  Ensure response options are exhaustive and mutually exclusive
-  If ambiguous, specify that one answer choice should be selected 

Example 5: 
<br><img src='/images/posts/survey_design/Slide5.JPG'><br>

Key points: 
-  Reduce complexity; ensure “yes” means yes, and “no” means no

Example 6: 
<br><img src='/images/posts/survey_design/Slide6.JPG'><br>

Key points: 
-  Label all response options; avoid using numbers
-  Ensure even spacing between response options
-  Align conceptual and visual mid point; may separate non-substantive choices
-  Use positive and negative side in question stem; for unipolar scales use “if at all”

Example 7: 
<br><img src='/images/posts/survey_design/Slide7.JPG'><br>

Key points: 
-  Use visual cues to make it easy to move across the grid
-  Ensure equal spacing
-  Break down large grids into a series of smaller grids
-  Label each column header, and consider labeling each response option


-   Ensure the question is technically accurate. Using specialized terms commonly used and accepted among the survey population will likely produce a more accurate measurement.
-   Make things as easy and simple as possible.
    -   Use complete sentences in question form, with a simple sentence structure and with simple and familiar words. Use specific and concrete words to specify the concept clearly. Do not be vague or allow room for varying interpretations. Avoid double negatives (ensure that "yes" means yes).
-   Do not embed the response options in the question stem.
-   When applicable, state both the positive and negative side in the question stem.
    -   For example, say "how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with..."
    -   Include "if at all" if applicable. For example ask, "how concerned are you, if at all, that ...".


# Designing Effective Answer Choices
-   Answer choices should include all reasonable possible answers and should be mutually exclusive.
-   Choose an appropriate scale length -- long enough to represent the entire continuum of answers, but without so many categories that they begin to burden respondents or differences become meaningless.
    -   For bipolar scales (e.g. questions asking for agreement and disagreement), 5 to 7 categories may be ideal. For unipolar scales (e.g. questions asking about level of concern), 4 to 5 may be ideal.
    -   For bipolar questions, including a middle, neutral point, does not make much of an impact; neither does starting with positives vs. starting with negative items. You just need to be consistent.
-   When considering non-substantive response options such as "don't know", "no opinion", "undecided", consider each question individually. Research is mixed and has found that such options may allow people to answer honestly or that it may provide an easy answer for those unmotivated.
-   Use forced-choice questions instead of check-all-that-apply questions. Participants are less prone to evaluate each item in check-all-that-apply questions, and more likely to select the first items of the list.
    -   Can list all the items as you would in the check-all-that-apply question but have participants select yes or no for each one, forcing participants to really consider each item.
-   If asking respondents to rank items, only ask them to rank a few items at a time, rather than a long list.
-   Beware of vague quantifiers (e.g. "sometimes", "often", etc.) that may mean different things to different people and mean different things for different questions.
-   Provide balanced scales where categories are relatively equal distances apart conceptually.
-   Ensure that question stem and answer options match. Use construct-specific scales; pose questions in a way that matches the response scale.
    -   For example, do not ask "To what extent do you agree or disagree that you enjoyed the movie?" It is much easier to answer this question when it is phrased more directly: "How much, if at all, did you enjoy the movie?"
-   Qualitatively label all categories. Do not list "1 Very satisfied", "2", "3", "4", "5 very dissatisfied".
    -   Do not use numeric labels from such answer choices, only use the qualitative labels.


# The Order of Questions
-   A questionnaire is not a compilation of independent questions that have no effect on one another. Surrounding questions are will influence how respondents interpret and answer questions.
-   Begin with salient and interesting questions. Participants will be more likely to respond, and as they proceed will build commitment to the questionnaire, reducing the likelihood stopping early.
    -   Initial questions should be connected to the purpose of the questionnaire to give the survey a feeling of consistency and help promote trust.
-   Place sensitive or potentially objectionable questions near the end of the survey. This way, respondents get to them after they have had an opportunity to become engaged with the questionnaire, and have established rapport with the surveyor/survey.
-   Group related questions together, and order questions about events in the order the events occurred. This is consistent with normal conversation and makes it easier for respondents to answer.
