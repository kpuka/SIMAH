Robin Purshouse, PhD, is Professor of Decision Sciences at the University of Sheffield. He led the CASCADE project that developed the foundational microsimulation methods and tools now being used and extended in SIMAH.

Robin’s research focuses on the development and application of advanced quantitative methods for informing population health policy. He has expertise in dynamical systems modelling, particularly exploring how agent-based models, capturing the bidirectional relationships between individuals and social structures, can explain change and stasis in population health outcomes over time.

Robin is interested in how psychosocial theories and evidential uncertainty can be incorporated into computer models to both explain and estimate the effect of policy. He has pioneered machine learning methods that fuse theory with data to discover competing explanations for observed long-term population trends in alcohol use in the USA.

Robin holds an MEng in Control Systems Engineering (1999) and a PhD in Control Systems (2004). Before returning to academia in 2008, he worked as a management consultant at PA Consulting Group. He was recipient of an ESRC Future Research Leaders award (2012-2014). He teaches undergraduate and postgraduate courses on agent-based modelling and decision systems at the University of Sheffield.

## Researchers

### Charlotte Buckley, University of Sheffield, UK
Charlotte Buckley, PhD, is a Research Fellow at the University of Sheffield. Her research is focused on the development and utilization of advanced quantitative methods to understand and explore population-level health behaviors. She has developed a dynamic microsimulation model of population alcohol use in the United States and has used this to explore the relationship beween alcohol use and liver cirrhosis. This model is being extended on the SIMAH project, to investigate associations between socioeconomic inequalities, alcohol use and mortality. 

Prior to joining the University of Sheffield, Charlotte received her PhD from the School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol. Her wider interests are in incorporating psychological factors into complex systems models of health behaviours and outcomes.
