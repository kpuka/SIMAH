My research focuses on the evaluation and treatment of the cognitive and mental health sequelae of pediatric chronic health conditions. Specifically, I have focused on children with epilepsy, of whom 80% experience cognitive, psychiatric, and/or psychosocial impairments. These comorbidities remain undiagnosed and untreated in two thirds of children and have been shown to predict poor long-term functioning and well-being, even more so than seizures. The **long-term goal** of my research is to improve the quality of life of children with chronic health conditions and to better understand the relationship between brain and behavior. To achieve this goal I will continue to pursue **two lines of research**: (1) identify the mechanism through which cognitive, psychiatric, and psychosocial impairments manifest among youth with chronic health conditions, and (2) design, evaluate, and implement clinical trials of behavioral interventions to ameliorate these impairments. The application of advanced quantitative methods and methods-development work borne out of methodological challenges psychologists face are also important aspects of my research program.
