# Purpose of Research Proposal
The goal of the grant proposal is to present a coherent, and carefully thought-out plan for a project that will address an important need that aligns with the funding agency's priorities. The proposal will be evaluated by scientific reviewers who should gain a clear understanding of the importance of the project, your plan for addressing the problem, and why you/your team are best equipped to successfully undertake the project. 

It is important to remember that the reviewer's specialty may differ from that of the research topic, and that reviewers will not fund a study they do not understand. Therefore, the research proposal should be understandable by a general scientific audience, and you should aim to make things as simple, explicit, and concrete as possible. The proposal should also be highly readable. Don't make reviewers work to understand your project. 

Consider the following general points to improve clarity and readability:
*	Leave nothing open to interpretation. Be direct and explicit in labeling the purpose of a sentence or section. Examples: 
  +	'This project is innovative because.'
  +	'The long-term goal of this project is..'
  +	'We are a multidisciplinary team spanning cardiologists, pathologists, epidemiologists and statisticians, with the expertise to undertake the proposed research because.'
	Use bolded, underlined, or italicized text (in moderation) to highlight key phrases to make them easy to find. Phases such as "long-term goal", "objective", "specific aims", "innovative".
*	Be mindful of the visual appearance of the proposal and ensure that it is not overcrowded. White space and page or section breaks are important to consider.  
*	Don't use a lot of acronyms or jargon 
*	Avoid using clichés (e.g. state-of-the-art equipment) and colloquialisms - assume reviewers may not be primarily English speaking or from Canada. 

As much as possible use the language of the agency guidelines, where applicable, to reinforce how your project fits with their funding priorities. If the agency is calling for innovative projects describe your project as "innovative", do not leave it to the reviewer to assume its innovative based on your scientific description of your project. Again, don't make reviewers work for it. 

# How Should the Proposal be Structured?

First and foremost, always follow the guidelines and never exceed the space allotted. 

Though writing styles and requirements from different agencies vary, an approach that is often recommended is to begin your grant proposal with a summary and the specific aims (the focus of this document), followed by a more detailed background section, the experimental design, measures, statistical analyses, and limitations and alternative plans. 

The summary and specific aims section should serve as an abbreviated summary of the entire proposal and provide reviewers with a guide of what to expect from the rest of your proposal. The language and terminology used in the summary and specific aims sections should be used consistently throughout the proposal to maintain consistency  The specific aims section is the most important part of the proposal because all subsequent sections should always link back and support the specific aims. The structure of this section can follow a specific formula (described below).

## Summary and Specific Aims Section

Requirements for each proposal will differ, but the section below provides a concrete example of how this section can be organized in four paragraphs: 

1. **Introduction**. The goal of the introductory paragraph is to ensure reviewers understand: a) the current knowledge in the field, b) the gap that constitutes an important problem, and c) the importance of address this gap. Consider using the following structure: 
*	Attention grabber/the Hook: Begin with an attention-grabbing sentence to establish the relevance of your proposal to human health. Be careful to not state information that would be intrinsically obvious to the reviewers. The sentence should compel the reader to read on.
  + Example: Although the majority of children with epilepsy achieve seizure control in the long-term, the cognitive, psychiatric, and psychosocial problems that are pervasive among 80% of children continue to persist. 
*	What is known: This part aims to ensure that all reviewers have the required background knowledge to understand the problem, and sets up the knowledge gap or the unmet need that will be addressed. 
*	Gap in Knowledge: Clearly state the gap that needs to be addressed and why it is important.        
  +	Examples: 'What is not known is.';     'Thus there is an urgent need for .'; 
                  'This lack of knowledge represents an important problem because.'
*	The Critical Need: This is the knowledge, technique, or treatment your proposal will develop; the reason your proposal should be funded. Emphasize the significance of the problem and that your research is the next logical step. You should state why your project is a timely investment. Is there any urgency to solving this problem sooner rather than later? What's the impact of not addressing this issue?

2. **Goals / Objectives**. The goal of the second paragraph is to introduce the solution to the identified gap/need. Include the following in this section:
*	Long-term Goal: The overarching goal and continuum of research that you will pursue over the course of multiple grants. This goal should be broad enough to encompass the gap or need identified previously. 
  +	Example: 'Our long-term goal is to ..'
*	Objective: Defines the purpose of the current grant application - what it seeks to accomplish, which should be to fill the gap/need identified previously. This should be focused on the product of the research (not the process) and should therefore be to either fill in the gap or meet a need. The objective should have a defined end point.
  +	It is not appropriate to state "to study X".  This is focused on the process (not the product) and there is no defined end point (i.e. when have you 'studied' a topic enough?) 
  +	Example: 'The overall objective of this proposal, which is the next step toward attaining our long-term goal, is to .'
*	Central Hypothesis: This should link to the Objective, should be testable, and should provide a focus (i.e. it should give direction to the research; it should serve to set up the specific aims, discussed below). Briefly explain the rationale for the hypothesis in this section, and if needed, refer to a more detailed explanation elsewhere in the proposal. Avoid vague hypotheses because it will be unclear what you expect to determine with the proposed research.
  +	Example: 'Our central hypothesis is that.'

3. **The Specific Aims**. The goal of the third paragraph is to describe the aims that will test the central hypotheses. There should be complete alignment between the Specific Aims and Central Hypothesis.  
*	Begin this section with a sentence like "We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of this application by pursuing the following specific aims:"
*	The aims should be related but should not be dependent on each other (e.g. Aim 2 should not rely on the success of Aim 1).
*	Each Aim should be in a separate line, numbered and indented, to improve readability.

4. **Summary / Impact**. The goal of the fourth paragraph is to create a firm, broad base to support the proposal, and can include the following information. 
*	Innovation: what makes your project innovative? 
*	Expected outcomes: Discuss the expected outcomes and why they are important. If this was discussed in the specific aims it may not need to be repeated here. 
*	Study Team: End this paragraph by indicating why you, your team, and your research environment are best positioned to accomplish this research. Keep it brief but emphasize that your team has the scope and breadth of experience necessary to successfully conduct the research.
*	Impact: Generalize the positive impacts that are anticipated from the expected outcomes. If applicable, this section should also speak to a) the jurisdictional context of the project and the impact/generalizability to other jurisdictions, and b) the potential cost-savings to the healthcare system, or other patient-, systems-, or societal-level benefits of the work. Addressing these points demonstrates you understand where your work is situated in the wider research setting.
Again, each proposal will be unique, and a different organization may need to be utilized. Nonetheless, consider the information outlined above and consider including the elements discussed in your grant proposal.



## Example of the Objectives and Specific Aims Paragraphs

Our **long-term goal** is to improve the quality of life of children with epilepsy. The **objective** of this pilot trial is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing drug A and B as an intervention for children with epilepsy. Our **central hypothesis** is that drug A and B will be successfully implemented, and that drug A will be more effective at improving seizure frequency and health-related quality of life, relative to drug B for children with epilepsy. 
We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the overall goal of this trial by pursuing the following **specific aims**: 
**Primary Aim:** 
1. To assess the feasibility of successfully implementing drug A as an intervention for children with epilepsy. Specifically, we will evaluate:
a)	Study procedures (e.g. recruitment, attrition, time to complete study procedures), 
b)	Participant adherence to treatment

This information will be essential in preparing for a subsequent multi-centered trial across Canada. Feasibility outcomes will be evaluated throughout the course of the study and the specific outcomes collected and evaluated are presented in Section X.

**Secondary aims** are to obtain preliminary data regarding the impact of drug A and B on:
2.	Children's frequency of seizures at 6-months follow-up.
3.	Children's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at 6-months follow-up. 

All secondary outcomes (efficacy outcomes) will be evaluated two weeks before the commencement of the drug and six months after commencement. The specific outcomes that will be collected and evaluated are presented in Section X.
