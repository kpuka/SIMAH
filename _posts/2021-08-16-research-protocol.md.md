# Purpose of Research Proposal
The goal of the grant proposal is to present a coherent, and carefully thought-out plan for a project that will address an important need that aligns with the funding agency's priorities. The proposal will be evaluated by scientific reviewers who should gain a clear understanding of the importance of the project, your plan for addressing the problem, and why you/your team are best equipped to successfully undertake the project.
