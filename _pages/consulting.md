Over the past 4 years I have worked as an independent statistical consultant, and as biostatistician for academic (e.g. Department of Medicine, Western University) and non-for-profit community organizations (e.g. The Brain Recovery Project). Through these experiences I have worked closely with a broad range of clients, providing scientific expertise, clearly explaining technical concepts, and interpreting and communizing results. I have extensive experience designing and implementing a variety of study designs, including randomized controlled, quasi-experimental, cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies. In addition, I have extensive experience with advanced data analysis, interpreting results, and communicating results for various statistical approaches, including generalized linear (mixed) models, growth curve modeling, structural equation modeling, scale development, meta-analytic methods, and unsupervised machine learning. I am proficient in using R, SAS, STATA, SPSS, and MPlus. 

I provide individual statistical and methodological consulting services, and can assist with: 
* Study Design
* Grant proposal development 
* Questionnaire design
* Data Management
* Data analysis and interpretation
* Data visualization 
* Scientific manuscript preparation


To inquire about these services and whether I may be able to help with your project, please email me (klajdi.puka@camh.ca). I'd be happy to answer any questions over email and/or set up a phone/video call.

You will get the most out of a consulting meeting if you can come prepared to discuss the following: (1) your research questions and hypotheses. What problem are you trying to solve? What do you expect to find? (2) any preliminary work you've done or methods you're considering using to analyze your data; and, if applicable, (3) analysis output, if you're struggling to interpret it.
