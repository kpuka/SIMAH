I am a Project Scientist at the Institute for Mental Health Policy Research at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto, Canada. My research focuses on identifying modifiable factors of health outcomes and implementing pragmatic randomized trials. Specifically, my first line of work has focused on modeling mental health outcomes over time and examining their interactions with clinical characteristics, family environment, health behaviors, and socioeconomic status. I have also worked closely with large population-based data, evaluating the impact of health behaviors and health inequalities on health outcomes and adverse events. This work has been used to inform my second line of work, focused on randomized control trials of behavioural interventions. 

Previously, I have worked as a methodologist/statistician and completed a PhD in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Through these experiences I have worked closely with a broad range of stakeholders, providing scientific expertise, critically apprising and synthesizing information, and clearly explaining technical concepts. I have advanced knowledge of clinical and epidemiological research methods and biostatistics, and importantly, I have developed excellent communication skills. Lastly, I have also built key relationships with multidisciplinary stakeholders and provided leadership by setting and overseeing the attainment of project goals, and managing competing interests, priorities and deadlines.

I also provide statistical and methodological consulting services at a nominal fee; for more information, click here [here](/consulting/).
