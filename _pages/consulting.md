and also work as a biostatistician for academic (e.g. Department of Medicine, Western University) and non-for-profit community organizations (e.g. The Brain Recovery Project). Through these experiences I have worked closely with a broad range of clients, providing scientific expertise, clearly explaining technical concepts, and interpreting and communizing results. I have extensive experience designing and implementing a variety of study designs, including randomized controlled, quasi-experimental, cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies. In addition, I have extensive experience with advanced data analysis, interpreting results, and communicating results for various statistical approaches, including generalized linear (mixed) models, growth curve modeling, structural equation modeling, scale development, meta-analytic methods, and unsupervised machine learning. I am proficient in using R, SAS, STATA, SPSS, and MPlus.
