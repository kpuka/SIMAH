I am a Project Scientist at the Institute for Mental Health Policy Research at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto, Canada. Previously, I have previously worked as a biostatistician for academic (e.g. Department of Medicine, Western University) and nonprofit community organizations (e.g. The Brain Recovery Project). Through these experiences I have worked with multi-disciplinary teams and research areas in developing and implementing a variety of study designs. I have extensive experience utilizing advanced quantitative methods, including generalized linear models, multi-level (mixed) models, growth curve modeling, structural equation modeling, scale development, meta-analytic methods, and unsupervised machine learning. I completed my PhD in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Western University, London, Canada.

My research focuses on identifying modifiable factors of health outcomes and implementing pragmatic randomized trials. Specifically, my work has focused on modeling mental health outcomes over time and examining their interactions with clinical characteristics, family environment, health behaviors, and socioeconomic status. This work has been used to inform randomized control trials of behavioural interventions. 

I provide statistical and methodological consulting services at a nominal fee. For more information, click here [here](/consulting/).
