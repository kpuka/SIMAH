My research focuses on identifying modifiable factors of health outcomes and implementing pragmatic randomized trials. Specifically, my work has focused on modeling mental health outcomes over time and examining their interactions with clinical characteristics, family environment, health behaviors, and socioeconomic status. This work has been used to inform randomized control trials of behavioural interventions. 

I am a Project Scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and works as a biostatistician for academic (e.g. Department of Medicine, Western University) and non-for-profit community organizations (e.g. The Brain Recovery Project). Through these experiences I have worked with multi-disciplinary teams and research areas in developing and implementing a variety of study designs. I have extensive experience utilizing advanced quantitative methods, including generalized linear (mixed) models, growth curve modeling, structural equation modeling, scale development, meta-analytic methods, and unsupervised machine learning. I completed his PhD in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Western University, London, Canada.
